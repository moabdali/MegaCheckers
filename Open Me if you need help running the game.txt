Hello!  If you have never run a python program off Github, don't worry!  It can be confusing at first, but it's really easy to get going!

1) Start off by installing the python interpreter if you haven't already.  https://www.python.org/downloads/  Make sure to tick the box that says "install path", if you have Windows. Also tell it to include PIP if the option shows up.

2) Hit Windows R, then type CMD, then enter

3) You need to install all the files in the requirements.txt text file.  As of the time of this help file being written, that means you'll need to install three things: PySimpleGUI, playsound, and Pillow.  To do this, simply type

pip install PySimpleGUI     and then hit enter and wait for it to finish
pip install playsound       and then hit enter and wait for it to finish
pip install Pillow          and then hit enter and wait for it to finish

4)  Now that the files are all "pipped", you can open up the MegaCheckers folder and double click the MegaCheckers.py file.  Enjoy!  If you have any issues, please don't hesitate to click issues and let me know.  https://github.com/MOABdali/MegaCheckers/issues/new
