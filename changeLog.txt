ChangeLog

v.0.9.103 July 23, 2020
	Much nicer item menu, changed pandemonium to shuffle all (pandemonium will be much crazier once implemented), fixed a huge "move again" glitch - should not crash anymore when using shuffles or making mistakes on the second turn; might still have errors for determining which piece moved again (more testing suggested).  Added purify column. Added messages and checking for cheetz. Added sound to spooky hand. 

v.0.9.102 July 23, 2020
	Fixed purify radial.  Added highlighting to purify radial.  Added purify row.  Added a nicer item read menu (shows pages, along with letters up top).  Changed color for "begin game".  Added some changes to better track of movement history (when turns end, when a piece moves again).  Corrected the alphabetical list (berzerk was before bernie sanders).  

v.0.9.101 July 22, 2020
	Fixed some more forcefield errors. Corrected a ton of round earth theory errors.  Added highlighting for round earth theory. Corrected some interaction errors between round earth theory and move diagonal (used to be able to teleport anywhere).

v.0.9.100 July 21, 2020
	Added Pandemonium (random shuffling of all tiles).  Fixed some errors with laser check (now correctly applies forcefields at the beginning of the turn and they last the entire turn).   Added a punch noise for haymaker.  Added a "get item" sound.  Added an elevation reference map. 
v.0.9.99 July 20, 2020
	Added study column.  

v.0.9.98 July 20, 2020
	Added sounds to vampiricism.  Corrected an error that showed your own buffs instead of your enemies when stealing powers with vampiricism.  Added an indicator for vampiricism.  Added sounds for Trump, canyon CRR, earthquake.

v.0.9.97 July 20, 2020
	Added some sounds (movement click, error when selecting/moving, selection click, pick up item).  Fixed an error in magnet.  Need to also fix the problem where opponents aren't able to pick up items when being magneted.  
	
v.0.9.96.1 July 19, 2020
	Added a small item explanations popup as an interim item log.

v.0.9.96 July 19. 2020
	Added canyon CRR, added invert elevation all, added seismic activity.

v.0.9.95 July 19, 2020
	Added Trump (build a wall)

v.0.9.94 July 19, 2020
	Added elevate tile and sink tile.  Added meat icons to berzerk.  Berzerk still needs an icon and piece indicator.


v.0.9.93 July 18, 2020
	Added Berzerk.  Began working on stopping pieces from jumping to higher tiles (nothing added for forced movement pieces yet such as haymaker).  Added the vampiricism explanation mentioned earlier.  Bezerk still needs a picture for the item, and a indicator.  Vampiricism needs an indicator as well. 

v.0.9.92 July 18, 2020
	Added steal powers CRR, steal items CRR, heir, and vampiricism.  Must add explanation for vampiricism to items explanation.
v.0.9.91.1 July 17, 2020
	Added a try except for pickupitems.  Added steal items column.
v.0.9.91 July 17, 2020
	Added more highlighting.  Fixed some tooltips freezing issues by doing a quick window.disappear and window.reappear function inside the tooltip update section.  More testing needed to verify.  Applied a "window always on top" setting again (and again fixed all popups to also have that) to further help with the perma-tooltips.  Picking up an item now shows a nicer formatted popup window complete with a centered image of the item, with the ability to hover over the image for a description.  

v.0.9.90.1 July 17, 2020
	Some progress made with highlighting squares after selecting an item.  Currently have the logic in for "hurt everyone in range" and "help only allies in range" and "hurt only enemies in range" (hurt = red, help = green, neutral = blue). 

v.0.9.90 July 17, 2020
	Completed adding pictures for every item, and (hopefully) correctly points to the correct file names for all the pictures.  Fixed some errors in the tutorial mode and removed references to the "use items" button, which is not really a user friendy way of playing the game (instead have the player double click a piece).  Reworked the intro screen to be able to show all items in the game for the item showcase (as in it has access to the entire item list).  Realphabetized the item list.  Reworked the item explanation function to use it for tooltips and regular explanations.   

v.0.9.89 July 16, 2020
	Added bernie sanders item.  Added pictures for every item so far (hopefully).

v.0.9.88 July 16, 2020
	Added explanations to every item.  Still need to enable/create pictures for all of them.  

v.0.9.87 July 16, 2020
	Added a turn counter frame on main menu, added the item orb forecast (should automatically update to accomodate any changes to the item list size), added a temporary placeholder button for the items "bestiary".  Renamed jumpProof.png to jump proof to match the in game png loader.  Also changed references to "abolish" to "vile" for now. 

v.0.9.86 July 15, 2020
	Preloading all .pngs to try to have max speed (and minimal disk wear).

v.0.9.85 July 15, 2020
	Per a tester's suggestions: alphabetized the picked up items, made it to where clicking away from the item menu closes it, removed the "space is at a premium" message when there's no more room for item orbs. Reworked code a little to avoid errors with highlighting.

v.0.9.84 July 15, 2020
	Added a bug fix/suggestions document for testers.  Added "keep on top" to all popups (this should really have had a universal toggle).  Removed the py version (was accidentally left over when creating the .pyw version).

v.0.9.83 July 15, 2020
	Added more highlighting, started using highlighting to show the range of an item, along with a confirmation message asking if you're sure you want to use it.  Currently highlights everything within range; may add a secondary highlight effect that shows specifically what units will be affected (for example, generic grey highlighting to show where it reaches, red to show what enemies are getting hurt, and green highlighting to show what allies are getting helped; or perhaps red to show any pieces that are getting hurt).  Also will make the range indicator not ask for confirmation if it's a "place an item down" type item as opposed to a "use it and it's done" item (in the interest of not showing too many popups). Renamed to PYW file to avoid the console from interfering as much.

v.0.9.82 July 14, 2020
	Fixed an error in getItems due to reuse of iterators (oops).  No longer crashes randomly.

v.0.9.81 July 14, 2020
	Added basic highlighting for movement - appears to properly show where a player can move to when either normal or equipped with move diagonal.  Properly avoids highlighting allies, and provides special highlighting for enemies.  Properly avoids highlighting broken floors.  Properly un-highlights after moving or deselecting. DOES NOT yet highlight properly for "around the world" pieces.  Will likely copy code from the around the world movement function.  

Need to also test whether it highlights tile changers (such as the secret agent or orb eaters).  Also plan to eventually add a range effect for items.  Will require a large amount of dedicated time on each item, so will likely want to try to finalize all items before I do that so I don't have to keep switching between implementing new items and working on highlighting. Also need to add wormhole detection for that feature.  


v.0.9.80 July 13, 2020
	Begun working on the first steps towards having a dynamic field in terms of heights.  Tiles change color from very dark grey (-2 elevation) to white (+2 elevation) to show how high a tile is.  Also moved a lot of files to the PNGList for memory loading.  Also programmed the intro screen to have a random item of the day so to speak (it changes every load, randomly). Linked it to a description function; which needs to be updated by the way. DO MORE TESTING ON POTENTIAL ERRORS RESULTING FROM THE PNG FUNCTION CHANGE.  Fixed an error where I forgot to add new test cases for destroyed floors from damaged5 to damaged8.

v.0.9.74 July 12, 2020
	Added an exclusion for bowling ball being learned by study or taught by teach (although technically it shouldn't be possible to teach), since it interferes with the rule that a piece can only know bowling ball.

v.0.9.73 July 12, 2020
	Added study row.  A piece can learn all the buffs your allies have in the row.  
v.0.9.72 July 12, 2020
	Correct some inconsistencies with jumpproof/jump proof in my code (forgot to update all references to using the two word version, causing it to be unactivable). Added tile tooltips so you can hover over a tile for information (last updates were only for the pieces themselves).  Does require testing since there's so many types of tiles. 

v.0.9.71 July 12, 2020
	Added care package airdrop.  It's a weirdly balanced item that drops item orbs around an opponent.  It can be used to insult your enemy by helping him, or on a enemy you've surrounded with your own pieces to buff up the pieces that are around him, or can be combined with shuffle orbs to hopefully get the orbs closer to yourself.

v.0.9.70 July 11, 2020
	Tooltips when hovering over player pieces (should add one for hovering over tiles as well).  Also fixed an error in the round earth theory function call.

v.0.9.69 July 11, 2020
	Minor change to disabling buttons to avoid errors easily (without dealing with a ton of catches). 

v.0.9.69 July 11, 2020
	Added an item dump item (needs a better name).  It takes all your unused items and drops them anywhere on the field as a large pickup that anyone can pick up.  

v.0.9.68 July 11, 2020
	Added the charity item.  It spawns a basic piece for your opponent.  Seems like a mainly useless joke item, but it can be used to mess with an opponent's plans, or be used together with steal type items, or to give yourself an easy target to kill if you need one.  

v.0.9.67 July 11, 2020
	Added teach column/radial/row.  Allows a piece to teach all of its buffs to affected allies.

v.0.9.66.1 July 11, 2020
	Alphabetized the items list for easier searching.  Added all items to the item orb pickup list (some were implemented, but unavailable for pickup due to this).  Moved item comments to the far left to make sure they are easier to find.  TODO: add descriptions for every item in the item description function.  Add pictures for every item for the itemMenu page.  Have the title page pull in information about all items using the pictures and description things just mentioned.

v.0.9.66 July 11, 2020
	Added shuffle row (why did I wait so long to do that?)

v.0.9.65 July 11, 2020
	Added a floor restore item. Restores damaged/missing floors.  Added a sticky bomb. Attach to any legal piece (illegal pieces are ones that can't be negatively affected, will be implemented in the future).  After five turns, explodes and destroys all surrounding tiles. 

v.0.9.63 July 11, 2020
	Improved title screen - bigger buttons, made the title two lines, added a base for showing a random item on each start up (needs programming to show the correct icon and whatnot.

v.0.9.62 July 11, 2020
	Added more animations to the floor repair, doubling the number of turns it takes for the floor to respawn. Also changed the colors to make it match the default grey so that it's more clear what's going on (black and white was a bit confusing; originally it made sense back when the floor was white). 

v.0.9.61 July 11, 2020
	A much better forcefield check has been created.  However, it requires work on surviving lasers that were used on pieces that aren't moving (that is, if you have a piece sitting a few rows directly above you, and you use the row laser, it'll die due to tricky programming requiring the laser to technically kill the piece first before the laser can apply).  This will be corrected in a future version.

v.0.9.60 July 10, 2020
	Created the mugger, he steals items from enemies and passes them to allies that visit him.  He's permanent.  Redid some of the moving code to make it nicer.  Created a shield function to faciliate usage of it (need to rewrite all the references to it).  


v.0.9.51 July 10, 2020
	Corrected an uncaught error in getRow/getColumn (used the format append(x,y) instead of append( (x,y) ).  Implemented mutual treason (row/column/radial), which forces all affected pieces to switch their owners.  This may cause glitches, so it'll be interesting to keep an eye out on this feature.  (Fortunately, the recall item and the treason items interact properly - with the piece retaining whatever allegiance it originally had).

v.0.9.50 July 10, 2020
	Basic deadman trigger's functionality.  Needs forcefield checks.

v.0.9.49 July 10, 2020
	Sorted movePiece code a little to make mystery box work easier.

v.0.9.48 July 10, 2020
	Added a mystery box.  It can do a random effect for either player. Currently gives 3 items, or takes away your items, or kills you.  Also caught an error in the cross check for "trueEmpty = True" (had wrong placement of + - 1 for columns).


v.0.9.47 July 9, 2020
	Put in the groundwork for a mugger; currently steals items and leaves.  May program him to give the owner the items.  Requires a huge rework of the move function

v.0.9.46 July 9, 2020
	Added a little bit of detail to the item explanation section for the recall.  Need to make sure future commits have item details added in that section as things are added in.

v.0.9.45 July 9, 2020
	Went back to debug mode.  Added recall, which makes a piece return in x turns (currently 10) to the tile that it cast it on, no matter what (even if the piece died or the tile moved or was removed), in the exact state it was in when using the item (item still gets used up first). Added some notes to how the orb eater works and added an extra shuffle feature to when it's looking for a new place to go to.  I should probably add some better AI that lets it "smell" an orb nearby. Also (in a recent change) forgot to note a "cleanTile" function was added to remove wormholes and orbEaters and other "non tangibles" from a tile (recall nodes are not affected).

v.0.9.44 July 7, 2020
	Temporarily disabled debug mode.  Enabled normal mode so that people can test it out.  Fixed a glitch in the "find current turn" function (used j[i] instead of j[1]).

v.0.9.44 July 7, 2020
	Item explanation button added; explains how the items work.
v.0.9.43 July 7, 2020
	Added reproduce; piece makes a newborn piece with no powers/items/buffs/debuffs in an adjacent location.

v.0.9.42 July 7, 2020
	Round earth theory has received a picture.  Worm hole implemented.  Better checks for making sure spots are "truly empty" (hotspots/orbeater).  Better default tile info. 

v.0.9.41 July 7, 2020
	Round earth completed (wrap around the field).  Needs a picture though. 

v.0.9.41 July 7, 2020
	Added mouse sound effects.  Made capititalization consistent in items list. 

v.0.9.40 July 7, 2020
	Implemented the orb eater.  Eats orbs.  Corrected some glitches such as where it gets overwritten if an item orb spawns on its location.  Needs to have some more checks implemented, such as not allowing items to be put on them.  Perhaps change to occupied tiles if mouse is on them?  Alternatively, this may cause issues with haymaker/bowling ball type pieces.  Mouse is intentionally immune to lasers and bombs.  

v.0.9.39 July 7, 2020
	Trimmed down code by removing a lot of debug messages and inert commented code

v.0.9.38 July 7, 2020
	Dynamically resized item menus - no longer have to worry about losing the cancel button once you have over 10 items.  However, it still looks bad after 15 items or so, so I need to program a feature that stops you from picking up over 15 items.

v.0.9.37.1 July 7, 2020
	Added vertical lasers.  Lasers properly interact with each other, including "cross beams".  Shuffling function has been made to act more pretty by adding a "turn lasers off only" keyword variable that shuts down the lasers when they're about to be shuffled (and then turned back on afterwards). !<Need to add checks for lasers touching haymakered pieces in a future commit>!

v.0.9.37.1 July 6, 2020
	Corrected the logic for lasers.  Should properly be shooting left and right.  No longer "hides" laser tripods if another one is already firing.  Laser emitters are intentionally immune to each other.  They can be placed down in another existing laser.  Idea: make lasers last X turns and make them fail after that many turns elapsed. 

v.0.9.37 July 6, 2020
	Added a lot of "preloading" for PNGs.  Should speed up the game. Glitchy row laser put in place.  Properly attacks to the left; gets confused about the right.  Partial commit to avoid code loss.

v.0.9.36.2 July 6, 2020
	Finished the left and right checks in haymaker.  Fixed a few errors with the bowling ball as well.  Bowling ball and haymaker should be finished for all intents and purposes (aside for dealing with lasers as they haven't been implemented yet).

v.0.9.36.1 July 6, 2020
	Fixed a few up/down errors in haymaker (crashed when hitting the walls; turns out the code wasn't properly tested; rewrote all the logic for that section).  Committing this and then working on left/right.

v.0.9.36 July 6, 2020
	Disable the main window when showing menus to avoid stray clicks that may cause crashes.  This is a lot simpler than putting in error checks for it while still doing the job (it does it better this way, too). 

v.0.9.35.1 July 6, 2020
	Implemented a message for when a piece falls into a void, and also a specific one for the bowling ball function.

v.0.9.35 July 6, 2020
	Bowling ball doesn't stun itself anymore (functionality doesn't change, as your turn ends either way), as I want the bowling ball to have a lore of being an almost unstoppable machine of destruction (on its turn).  That said, it'll be invincible against lasers on its own turn, but WILL fall into the void on opponent's turn (and die to any negative effects that occur on the opponent's turn). 

v.0.9.34.2 July 5, 2020
	Finished most of the downwards aspect of bowling ball- found some logic flaws.  Need to still add laser check and hole check.  Currently properly collides with allied piece and destroys the first enemy piece it crashes into.  Stuns itself when it stops moving and ends your turn (it's a very strong piece).

v.0.9.34.1 July 5,2020
	Mostly done with the "down" aspect of the bowling ball. 

v.0.9.34 July 5, 2020
	Added the framework for a bowling ball item.  Needs to have the movement implemented.  Currently properly transforms a piece into a bowling ball and prevents it from moving normally.  Shows a menu allowing user to pick up/down/left/right (but menu doesn't work yet)


v.0.9.33 Created this changelog (this file used to be part of the README).  Added sound support with the playsound module.

v.0.9.32 Fixed some issues with the highlight feature that conflicted with shuffles.  Also found an error with an out of place remove("shuffle column") that was under the "shuffle radial" section.

v.0.9.31 Spooky hand has been created. Needs a better animation.

v.0.9.30 Added a function that better tracks when your piece should be highlighted. 

v.0.9.29 Added a cheat button that gives all pieces a specified item.  Useful for debugging; will probably remove for the actual game.  Changed snake icon.

v.0.9.28 Made the code look formatted nicer (especially long lists).  Removed a lot of commented code that is confirmed unnecessary.

v.0.9.27 Magnet fully implemented (I think).  Added a mapper function to support the suck0in effect.  

v.0.9.26 Haymaker almost fully implemented - your piece should die if it has a trip mine attached or if it hits a mine/hole in any direction. I say almost fully because I have to implement tile heights as a concept before that aspect can be worked on.  But as-is, everything should be good.

v.0.9.25 Shuffle radial implemented.  Added some arrows for the items, but haven't implemented them yet.  Will include with next commit hopefully, along with shuffle row.

v.0.9.24 Shuffle column implemented, with a neat step by step removal and replacement of pieces.  Shuffling does not affect tripmines since technically the tile is warped out of play and replaced back into existence... the actual piece never moves off the tile. Also combined the print message and window["information"] messages into one function.

v.0.9.23 NO LONGER WRITES TO DISK.  HUGE PERFORMANCE GAINS! Also, corrected a glitch where pieces will explode if they kill an enemy on their second (or higher) turn.  Also moved all the images into the image folder.

v.0.9.22 Attempted to work on animated images, but it didn't work out (could be a limitation on pysimplegui/tkinter, researching on solution).  Made item menu prettier, but in early stages and only shows a handful of items.  

v.0.9.21 added a prettier item orb.  Delaying the item menu slightly while I work on an animmated item orb.

v.0.9.20 added some better graphics for purify radial and abolish radial.  Fixed an error where killing someone while trip mined does not kill you.  Fixed an error where move again buffs don't show up properly on turn 0 (which technically won't happen in a real game, but I still would rather have that case accounted for).  Fixed an error that says that you wasted a purify or abolish (the message appeared if the first attempted square was already empty of buffs/debuffs instead of waiting to check all of them; this was due to a bad indentation).  Modified sleep times to be lower, making the game more responsive (this is possible due to the output messages from v0.9.10 allowing you to see messages that flashed by too quickly in the information box).  Temporarily disabled the title menu to save a click (and like 5 seconds per debug). Immediate to-do for next commit:  make the item menu neater.  

v.0.9.19 temporary trip mine visuals added, fixed a logic glitch where dying from moving a trip mined piece allows the player to move again.  Post edit: also made the items menu be "always on top"

v.0.9.18 better trap orb logic - you can now move off your own orb and it'll stay there without being consumed. Removed some debug messages

v.0.9.17 added trap orbs item (puts down a mine that looks like a normal orb, but doesn't affect you if you placed it), and fixed a glitch in move again that gave you unlimited turns (missing a return statement when a player says no to moving again, ironically). However, the item orb disappears when you step on your own, so that logic needs to be updated or the item changed to do something else if you pick it up.

v.0.9.16 Corrected some death check errors that occur due to piece dying early and not properly setting the space as "not occupied".  Added "always on top" to all popups to avoid errors where the popup disappears.

v.0.9.15 Added a mine item.  Added a death check related to traps (to make it easier to program new traps without a ton of checks being needed each time); can be used to replace existing code if I feel like it

v.0.9.14 Added better move again icons (and implemented them).

v.0.9.13.1 Hotfix:  was missing a continue command in the previous code.  Whenever a piece was killed, instead of continuing, it would "return", ending the player's turn.  It should be working properly from now on.  

v.0.9.13 Mostly complete with "move again".  There appears to be a glitch occurring with stacking move again powerups - if you keep moving around normally, there are no issues.  But it seems that you lose turns if you click on a wrong piece between moves or if you pick up an item.  More testing will  need to be done, but uploading this build, along with a temporary limit of one "move again buff" so that my code is backed up for the former, and so that I don't spend too much time on a situation that will likely rarely occur anyway (for the latter).

v.0.9.12 Added move diagonal.  

v.0.9.11 Finished all directions of the haymaker.  Still need to do laser/mine checks.  Will probably do that after I actually program some mines and lasers.

v.0.9.10 Overhauled the graphics.  Uses 3d images made in Paint 3d along with dynamically generated pieces with regards to power ups and whatnot.  Also changed some errors in code flow (continues when finishing up each activity in displayBoard) and added a console output in case someone misses a message (also removed many sleep commands now that it's ok for them to miss a message; this helps the game feel more responsive). 

v.0.9.9 Added haymaker power up as well as fixed some logic errors with items not getting picked up if a piece was forced there (this was technically not a glitch because until now there wasn't a way to end up on an item tile without intentionally moving there; this is more of a new feature, if anything)

v.0.9.8 Added a "stunned" debuff concept.  Pieces that are stunned cannot move or attack until the player has had one turn (this means if you stun your own piece, you can't use it this turn, but you can the next. However, if you stun your opponent's piece, their piece won't be unstunned until you finish your current turn AND their turn ends)

v.0.9.7 Added trip mine radial, including updating the move function to account for a player moving.  Need testing to see if forcefields properly protect you.  Functionality intends that you can use one shield to protect against any number of simultaneous trip mine blasts. 

v.0.9.6 Added purify radial and abolish foe power radial.

v.0.9.5 Added napalm radial  Consider adding a cheat menu for easier debugging

v.0.9.4 Added napalm row

v.0.9.3 Added napalm column

v.0.9.2 Added a crossCheck function to make snake tunneling and similar cross checks easier.  Also, added snake tunneling.

v.0.9.1 Added smartBombs (better air strike).  Added better handling of when you click an empty space or an enemy (instead of waiting on you to click a second square after making a false selection, it immediately tells you that you made an invalid choice and starts over).  Consider changing it to where clicking on the same non-owned square twice gives you the information popup instead.

v.0.9: Added the jumpproof item.

v.0.8.9: Added functions to check for radial/column/row.  This will reduce errors and speed up implementation of new items.

v.0.8.8: Modified all popups to always stay on top.

v.0.8.7: Selected pieces appear grey now.  There's a player turn indicator. Reduced spacing between tiles.  

v.0.8.6:
	Added a button to exit the program safely.  TKinter has an error where it breaks if you hit the X button, so the exit button is disabled now.  I also reformatted the tutorial window to look a little neater.

v.0.8.5:
	Added a tutorial that explains the basics and teaches you how to select units, how to move units, how to use an item, and (eventually) how to inspect tiles and pieces.  Tutorial todo: make formatting prettier, catch errors based on clicking the options instead of a button (might just disable buttons to make it safer), and to add the "inspect" tutorial.  Eventually need something for raising/lowering tiles.

v.0.8.4:
	Starting a simple tutorial mode to teach new players.

v.0.8.3:
	Added Wololo - allows you to steal an enemy's piece.  Needs to have the range properly added in.  Also for far future:  need to make a tutorial.

v.0.8.2:
	Added a haphazard bombing run.  Added floor damage (and floor repair).  Added some explosions.  Next update should make it to where if a piece is exploded, an explosion shows up.

v.0.8.1:
	Renamed suicideRow to SuicideBomb Row (so that you know it kills everyone and that it's not just suiciding your pieces).  Added a suicide column.


v.0.8:
	Has an updated avatar serving function.  It'll automatically keep track of what your avatar should be so that you (I) don't have to manually reassign them for each scenario.  Also, the shield (forcefield) feature has been successfully implemented.  Avatars appear to properly update on every combination involving (or not involving) shields and holding items.

v.0.7:
	Has an examine option now.  You can check public stats about the pieces and gameboard.  Features checks that prevent the buttons from being enabled if it won't flow with the game's logic.  (For example, the button is disabled if you click "use item" before clicking a piece that can use an item).  To do: add the shield, test if the pieces revert to normal.  Test to see if buffs show up properly (shield).

v 0.6:
	Can keep track of empty spaces now. Orbs exist now. You can pick up items now.  The only item implemented is the "suicide row", but it's confirmed working.  The avatar attribute is now in effect.  Your piece's avatar changes color when it's holding an item.  (Haven't tested whether it disappears when it's used up since the only working item right now kills you anyway).  Corrected in error in keeping track of the location of pieces (forgot to change i,j to rows-i-1,j for the initialization procedure).  Added an item button that greys out when not valid.  Changed the visual size of the field to help fit on smaller monitors.  To do: add the option to view the stats of an orb (maybe via a context menu?), add more items (shield most likely).  Test to make sure pieces revert to normal when they don't have an item held anymore.

v 0.5.1:
	Spawn orbs now.  Spawns in legal locations.

v 0.5:
	Major logic changes.  No longer use a "player" class, as it seems pointless, at least at the moment.  Instead, the gameBoard list now contains two elements per location - a tile object slot to keep track of the tile (its conditions), and a piece object to keep track of the pieces (their items, location, and ownership).  This should result in easier coding going forward.  Beginning work on tracking empty spaces for item orb spawns.  

v 0.4:
	Put in even more information frames, including number of pieces left.  Messages show up more neatly now.  Considering a log output somewhere on the side or bottom. 

v 0.3:
	Put in a information frame on bottom, game properly calculates whether you can move to a location (diagonals have NOT been implemented yet - that will be added when that item is added to the game; same with "around the world" items that let you move pacman style from the right edge of the field to the left, for example).  Popups have been removed since all info appears on the bottom now. Still need todo the item generation.

v 0.2:
	Gameboard properly updates between turns.  Pieces can move around anywhere (teleporting). Pieces can kill.  Turns are properly tracked and a player can't move his piece twice (opposing players can't control their opponent's pieces).  To do: generate items and allow them to be picked up.  Note: this requires changing the board logic to go from "0" for a blank area to having a 1 for denoting that items exist.  Alternatively, may need to have a new class to represent spaces as eventually I'll want the floor to be raised and damaged and whatnot. 

v 0.1:
	Starting right out with a GUI.  Currently shows the field and properly generates the starting pieces and has a logical gameboard that gets displayed for debug purposes in the console.  The next commit should feature the ability to move the pieces around, followed by a commit for properly killing a piece, followed by generating items, then picking up items, then using items (with just a print message for now).
